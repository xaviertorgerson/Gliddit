Gliddit is a simple javascript program for quickly browsing reddit with your arrow keys.  It is a very quick way to leaf through your favorite subreddits.

Test it out here!  https://xaviertorgerson.github.io/Gliddit/

It uses a JFrame to embed the webpage which not all pages allow so it's most useful for browsing images.

This project was started in the Winter of 2013 I uploaded incase anyone would find it interesting I will merge pretty much anything.  I may continue to work on it at somepoint I added issues if anyone wants to start there.
